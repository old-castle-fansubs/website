{% block project_synopsis %}
  <p>School girl Haneoka Meimi transforms into the mysterious thief St. Tail,
  and steals back what was stolen or taken dishonestly. She's assisted by a
  classmate and sister-in-training, Mimori Seira, whose position in the church
  after school each day allows her to hear the troubles of those who have been
  wronged and have come to pray to God.</p>

  <p>While St. Tail steals to right the wrongs done to innocent people, she's a
  thief to the police force. Her classmate Asuka Daiki Jr., called Asuka Jr.,
  and son of Detective Asuka, is hot on her trail. St. Tail delivers notices of
  her planned capers to Asuka Jr., to give him a fair chance to catch her.</p>
