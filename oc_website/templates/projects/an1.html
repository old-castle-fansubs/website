<p>The story is about Ayuhara Kozue, a 12-year-old girl who transferred to
Fujimi College and tried out for the school volleyball team. She develops a
friendship with her teammate Hayakawa Midori, and her talents impress coach
Hongou more and more each day. Kozue discovers that being at the top would
bring stress, incompatibilities and other dilemmas into her life. Her high
expectations of becoming the best volleyball player in the school, Japan and
eventually the world, set the tone for the drama to follow.
