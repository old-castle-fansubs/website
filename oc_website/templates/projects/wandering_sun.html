{% block project_synopsis %}
  <p>Two baby girls were born in the same hospital: one of them is the daughter
  of an aristocratic family while the other belongs to a depraved household
  which lives in the slums of the city. However, the nurse-in-charge, Michiko,
  secretly switches the two babies due to a personal grudge, resulting in a
  change of fates of the girls from then on. Many years later, the lives of the
  two girls continue to be intertwined with each other, with the rich Miki
  ill-treating the poor Nozomi, yet both of them hold similar dreams to become
  a singer.
