Wandering Sun
ongoing

<p>Two baby girls were born in the same hospital: one of them is the daughter
of an aristocratic family while the other belongs to a depraved household which
lives in the slums of the city. However, the nurse-in-charge, Michiko, secretly
switches the two babies due to a personal grudge, resulting in a change of
fates of the girls from then on. Many years later, the lives of the two girls
continue to be intertwined with each other, with the rich Miki ill-treating the
poor Nozomi, yet both of them hold similar dreams to become a singer.
