{% block project_synopsis %}
  <p>Lute and his friends Cheval, Lilia, and Navirou live in Hakum Village,
  where chosen children learn to be Riders. Riders form a bond with friendly
  monsters called Monsties hatched from eggs, riding them as mounts for travel
  and combat. Due to monster riding being a taboo skill in a society filled
  with monster hunters, Hakum Village is isolated from the outside world and
  keeps its riding tradition a secret to all but a few privileged individuals.
  As Lute adventures with his friends and learns more about monster riding, a
  past threat remerges called the Dark Blight, infecting the nearby forest and
  leading to more aggressive monster attacks. A new generation of riders now
  has to find a way to stop the blighted monsters without having to destroy
  them outright.
