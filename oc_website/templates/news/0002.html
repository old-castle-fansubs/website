        <strong>Updated source to 720p BD rip</strong> (thanks, metalotaku)

        <p>We've started using high quality RAWs grabbed from nyaa.se while it was
        still alive. We didn't reencode anything for a few reasons:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>We don't have any experienced encoder.</li>
            <li>We didn't want to decrease the audio/video quality.</li>
            <li>Our previous source seems to be badly reencoded video from the current release.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A single episode weighs about 600 MB which in our opinion is
        acceptable.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Replaced font</strong> (thanks, rpgmaniac)

        <p>We decided to fix the issues with the font rpgmaniac has pointed
        out, and this time we proceeded much more carefully with our
        choices.</p>

        <p>After many trials and errors, we arrived at bold Gotham Rounded
        Medium, stretched horizontally to 94% with the size of 43 libass units.
        We changed the font color as well, but have decided against making it
        completely white and kept it slightly yellow to match the tint of the
        video (extra points for providing the retro feel).</p>

        <p>Hopefully it won't be an eyesore for the modern watchers like the
        previous release. We're quite satisfied with the end results :)</p>

    <li>Changed wording here and there</li>
