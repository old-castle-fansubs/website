  Merry X-mas, everyone! It's been a busy year for Old Castle. This year, we
  have worked on the subtitles for the following series:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><td>Attack No. 1</td><td>finished</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Attack No. 1 movies</td><td>finished</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Ichigatsu ni wa Christmas</td><td>finished</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Wandering Sun</td><td>finished</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Umi no Yami, Tsuki no Kage</td><td>finished</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Famous Dog Lassie</td><td>finished</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Paris no Isabelle</td><td>ongoing</td></tr>
  <tr><td style='opacity: 0.5'>(remaster) Glass Mark</td><td>finished</td></tr>
  <tr><td style='opacity: 0.5'>(remaster) Saint Tail</td><td>ongoing</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  And today one more title is added to this list – our X-mas gift of this year:
  <a href='{{ url_for('project', project_name='gensei_shugoshin') }}'>"Gensei
  Shugoshin Pi-hyoro Ikka!"</a> It's a 3-episode-long comedy OVA about
  Buddhist exorcists. It features a Christmas episode, too!
</p>

<p>
  As some of you might have noticed, starting with "Umi no Yami, Tsuki no Kage"
  we stealthily started doing dual language releases (English + Polish). The
  initial motivation was to make our work more accessible to our families :)
  But we've discovered that it also improves the quality of the translation,
  since Polish (which is the native language of our translator) maps to English
  much better than Japanese. This makes it easier to "organize" the dialogues
  first in a language that we know the best, and then map it to English which
  is in the same Indio-European language family.
</p>

<p>
  A bit of technical news, but we'll most likely miss the release cycle on 9th
  of February due to vacation. In addition, the work for "Ashita e Attack" is
  going well and we expect to start releasing it after "Paris no Isabelle".
</p>

<p>
  Last, but not least, we already have a couple of exciting ideas for the next
  year! We're not ready to share anything specific yet, but we hope you'll
  enjoy them when the time comes. Thank you for being with us through all this
  time and all of your comments on Nyaa and the guest book – they mean a lot to
  us. We wish you a wonderful holiday season and all the best in the year to
  come.
</p>
