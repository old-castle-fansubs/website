<h1>About us</h1>

<p>Founded in 2017 for the purpose of subbing "Attack no. 1", the group is only
starting out. After we finish our first series, in the future we might possibly
sub others. Our focus is on the series that have slight chances of being picked
up by other groups. We favor quality over speed.</p>
