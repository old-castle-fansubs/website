<p>Maya is a young girl who is not the prettiest nor smartest girl in the world,
but is a devout actress. She dreams of becoming a famous actress, but her
mother forbids it. So one day, Maya runs away to go to an acting school run by
a hasbeen actress, Chigusa Tsukikage, whose face was scarred during a
performance. There, Maya endures and the trials and tribulations of acting in
order to triumph.
