Monster Hunter Stories

<p>As some of you may have already noticed we've picked up "Monster Hunter
Stories: Ride On" season 2, which Crunchyroll stopped releasing due to
licensing issues. So far we've released <a href='releases.html'>7
episodes</a>.</p>

<p>We don't have any particular release schedule for this show. We'll try to
release each episode as soon as we can, but please be advised that we're
nothing like modern fansubbers who release within hours after airing. Please
expect delays.</p>

<p>We thank <strong>DranzerX13</strong> for providing high quality RAWs.</p>
